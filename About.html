    Jo Jo’s Events started with one simple thing: a serious love for planning parties. From organising family celebrations to taking charge of every detail, our founder quickly became the go-to person for making events look amazing and run smoothly. 
    <br>Before long, that passion turned into helping others plan some of life’s biggest moments — including weddings. Between timelines, table plans, and “don’t forget the flowers,” Jo Jo’s Events was growing. To take things to the next level, our founder completed a floristry course, adding a creative floral touch to every celebration. 
    <br>Today, Jo Jo’s Events brings together organisation, creativity, and a whole lot of heart to create events that feel effortless, personal, and unforgettable.
