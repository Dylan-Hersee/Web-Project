    Jo Jo’s Events started with one simple thing: a passion for making events personal. From organising family celebrations to taking charge of every detail, our founder quickly became the go-to person for creating events for family and friends.
    <br>Before long, that passion turned into helping others plan some of life’s biggest moments — including weddings. Between timelines and table plans, ” Joanne's experience was growing. To take things to the next level, our founder completed a floristry course, adding a creative floral touch to every celebration. 
    <br>Today, Jo Jo’s Events brings together organisation, creativity, and bounds of heart to create events that feel effortless, personal, and unforgettable.
